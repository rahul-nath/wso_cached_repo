      <p> 
	Comments should be true, and based on personal experience. You can only
	review your current room and building, but that may change in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
	Currently, we do not have enough
	information on Co-op or First-year housing to make them available.
      </p>
      <p>
	When you post a review, you'll see an option for making it anonymous.
	If you choose to make your review anonymous, we will hide both your 
	noise and general comment until the next school year. 
      </p>
      <p>
	While Dormtrak is designed to be as open as possible, inappropriate comments 
	will not be tolerated, and comments can be removed or edited at the discretion 
	of the student moderator to bring them into accordance with this policy. 
	Inappropriate comments include, but are not limited to, comments that name 
	other students, that contain racial or ethnic slurs, and those that harass 
	others. Spamming a building or room with incorrect information, for example
	in an effort to dissuade others from potentially choosing that dorm, will
	result in being banned from further use of Dormtrak. 
      </p>
      <p>
	You are allowed a max of one review per room. You can edit and delete your 
	reviews, but when you delete your review we hold onto some of the statistical
	information you provide us (like whether or not your room has a keypad to
	get in). 
      </p>
      <p>
	By using Dormtrak, you agree to abide by this policy.
